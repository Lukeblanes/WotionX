# WotionX
WotionX is a GUI application inspired by Notion. 

Notion is a great piece of software but it is overkill for some of the tasks I use it for in my day to day.

Suggestions are welcome.

## Why was the project started?
- Be able to have as many elements as possible. ( Notion has a limit on a thousand )
- Have only some of the functionalities.
- Improve GUI program.
